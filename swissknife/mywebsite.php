        <p>From a Sales and Management background, I always wanted to learn more about technology.
        The truth is through my work experiences, I often had a lot of workmates struggling with computers or devices and their interface.
        So I thought, "I wish I could understand it and explain it to them, so that their frustration goes away" and so my boss would be nicer to me and promote me in the process".
        </p>
        <p>Now learning a computer's language was a challenge.
        Yes having some background in it would have been helpful but nevermind, we'll do with what we've got.
        The journey can be difficult, but if you learn Java, JavaFX and mobile development, you can build anything you like.
        From sport management desktop application to a health and wellbeing mobile app.
        The sky is your limit.</p>
